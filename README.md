Web application for organizing team meetings through multi-user calendar overlap and scheduling links.

## Vision Statement 

Producing a visually pleasing web application that would revive human connection through efficiently generated team or individual meetings. 

## Story Telling Diagram

## Case Example 

Suppose you’re a professor and you want to create a meeting at a certain time this week. You use Doodle and sent your several suggested time slots for the day or week. However, it turns out that all of your students are taking other common courses which have exams at the time of your suggested time slots. Therefore, they would obviously reject all of your time slots or you may get a very low number of responses, without knowing the cause. A calendar based app will ultimately solve all these types of issues.

## Market Needs

We believe that the current market lacks a complete design-efficient team or individual scheduling software. Therefore, we as developers felt responsible to provide a visually pleasing software that is accessible to a wide range of workplaces and age groups. Additionally, we believe that people are more and more integrating their personal and work life events to their respective calendars, which enters our product into a positive feedback loop that can only make it grow by the day.

Furthermore, we acknowledge the difficulty of organizing events within packed teams. For instance, if a group of university students wanted to organize a team meeting, they would accomplish this task by sending their respective individual course schedules to a messaging application hoping to manually find a free time slot. We developed our software to eliminate such scenarios by replacing it with our time-efficient automated software.

## Features 

* Feature #1: Overlapping multiple individual calendars into a team calendar.
* Feature #2: Ability to create a team meeting using the free time slots produced.
* Feature #3: Adding team events to each of the originally used individual calendar.
* Feature #4: One to one meetings.
* Feature #5: Instant and easy access to event location via Google Maps.
* Feature #6: Instantly retrieve events saved onto your Google Calendar

## Limitations 

Due to the fact that our software’s only login method requires a Google account, our main limitations are attributed to the Google Terms of Service.

However, this limitation is not as negative as it seems, since Google is one of the top 3 email clients worldwide, and it is still growing at a rapid rate. This is numerically evident as Gmail grew from 425 million in 2012 to over billion monthly active users in 2016.

Furthermore, one of the terms of service that Google require is for the account owner to be above 13 years of age. Consequently, our software’s most significant limitation would be Google’s age requirement. Nonetheless, this limitation also works to our advantage since our software requires a technical skill set which is less commonly found in people under 13 years of age.

## Exclusions

In order to maintain team stability and security, we gave most authority to the user who created the team (admin). We will not give all team members (excluding the team admin) the ability to remove other members from the team or delete team events created by other members. Furthermore, we did not grant the option for any team member to delete a team that they joined. They may only remove themselves from the team.

This is because it is possible for one of the members to have a fallout with the team creator and so he or she can use their ability to delete members as a result of their dispute with the team admin.

Similarly, a team member may have a fallout with another team member where both are not admins, and so there is the risk of one of them deciding to delete the other member which is not ideal for the team or the team admin.

Additionally, in order to maintain privacy between team members, we will not show their personal event information such as title or description on their free-busy time slots. The only information accessible to all team members are their fee and busy time slots which are visually and distinctively coloured.
